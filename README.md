# CeloHT

CeloHT is a community-focused project built on the Celo blockchain. It supports education, local economic activity, and reforestation using simple digital tools. The project uses only cUSD and CELO. No tokens, no speculation.



## About the Project

CeloHT is designed to make blockchain useful in everyday life. The project is built on three foundations:

### 1. Education  
Training materials and practical sessions that help people understand mobile payments, digital savings, and basic financial literacy.

### 2. Agents  
Local agents assist communities with onboarding, payments, and verified field activities. Their contributions can be logged and supported using cUSD.

### 3. Reforestation  
Tree-planting events can be recorded and verified for transparency and environmental monitoring. Communities track planting progress over time.


## How It Works

- Uses **cUSD** for stable payments  
- Uses **CELO** for transaction fees  
- Compatible with wallets like Valora and Celo Wallet  
- No native token  
- Designed to work in low-resource environments
